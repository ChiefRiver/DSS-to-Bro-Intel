# DSS-to-Bro-Intel
Converts DSS IOCs (Indicator of compromise) into the Bro Intel framework format.

Run this program against a DSS IOC file and it should extract all Bro Intel relevant info and then supply that info in the Bro_Intel format. The output can then be coppied directly into Bro Intel framework. 

Because DSS supplies IOCs with many different formats it may not work on all DSS supplied files.
